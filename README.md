# Galois

## Overview

Galois is a mathematical exploration project focusing on topics related to Galois theory and calculus concepts. This repository contains LaTeX documentation with accompanying diagrams.

## Repository Contents

### Files

- **Tangent.tex** - LaTeX source file containing the main mathematical documentation
- **Tangent.pdf** - Compiled PDF version of the LaTeX document
- **pd1.jpg**, **pd2.jpg**, **pd3.jpg** - Supplementary diagrams and visual aids for the mathematical content

## Description

This project documents mathematical concepts, particularly focusing on tangent lines and related calculus principles. The content is professionally typeset using LaTeX and includes visual diagrams to support understanding.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile the LaTeX source files, you'll need:
- A LaTeX distribution (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX, MacTeX)
- A LaTeX editor or command-line tools

### Viewing

- Simply open `Tangent.pdf` to view the compiled documentation
- Alternatively, view the diagrams directly: `pd1.jpg`, `pd2.jpg`, `pd3.jpg`

### Building from Source

To recompile the LaTeX document:

```bash
pdflatex Tangent.tex
